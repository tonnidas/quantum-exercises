Why: I did the mini-project as it was a part of the course. Every student was required to complete a quantum mini-project and I chose to work with classifiers. Abstract: In recent years, researchers are looking into data transformations in the quantum information space to see whether they may improve robustness and performance.</description></item><item><title>Final Exercises Solutions</title><link>https://tonnidas.github.io/quantum-exercises/post/ex1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tonnidas.github.io/quantum-exercises/post/ex1/</guid><description>As the final assignment of Quantum-Computing course, I solved the following problems.
