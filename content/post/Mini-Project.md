### When: 
- In summer2 of 2021, I took the Quantum-Computing course provided by baylor.

### Why: 
- I did the mini-project as it was a part of the course. Every student was required to complete a quantum mini-project and I chose to work with classifiers.

### **Abstract:** 
- In recent years, researchers are looking into data transformations in the quantum information space to see whether they may improve robustness and performance.  The evolution of quantum mechanics occurred because it could explain specific scenarios in which conventional formulas failed.  As a result,it began to expand in analytical research domains such as machine learning, and it is now capable of functioning correctly, and in some circumstances better than classical machine learning. Classification is one of the crucial areas in Machine Learning (ML), and quantum classification analysis has started to gain prominence.  In this paper, we focus on implementing four classification algorithms such asSupport Vector Classification with Quantum Kernel (SVCQK), Quantum Support Vector Classifier(QSVC),  Variational  Quantum  Classifier  (VQC),  and  Circuit  Quantum  Neural  Network  Classifier(CQNNC). We also provide analytical results of case studies with various generated classifiable and semi-classifiable  datasets.   This  study  is  to  determine  whether  quantum  information  theory  mayshorten learning time or improve convergence when compared to traditional approaches.
